## Issues:
*  Tabletop.js takes a lot of time to load the data from google sheet.
*  We have to refresh the web page multiple times to draw the chart on screen.
*  Irresponsive design makes it difficult to use it on different devices.
## Data Set:
The Data set used was taken from WHO-Covid-19 Data set and it is showing the data till 10th Aug, 2021  
## Upcoming Updates:
I will make some possible changes in this project to remove these issues.
